## Introduction
The study of protein-structure is essential for understanding their functions and interactions in biological systems. The paper "Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons" proposes a novel approach to learn from protein structures using geometric vector perceptrons (GVPs). The authors of the paper demonstrate that their method outperforms existing methods on several protein structure prediction tasks.

In this paper/review, we will analyze the key components of the paper and provide an exposition of its strengths, weaknesses, and potential for further development. We will also describe our novel contribution, which aims to improve the accuracy of the proposed method by incorporating protein-bert.

We will first provide a brief overview of related work in the field of protein structure prediction. Previous approaches have relied on various techniques, including machine learning, evolutionary analysis, and structural modeling. However, these methods have their limitations, such as requiring significant computational resources or being restricted to specific types of proteins.

The paper "Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons" presents a promising alternative approach that utilizes the geometric properties of protein structures to learn and predict their functions. The method involves representing protein structures as graphs and applying GVPs to extract features that capture the geometry of the protein.

In the next section, we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and identify areas where further improvement is possible.
